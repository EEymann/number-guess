## Description

_This number guessing game comes from a practice project originally from teamtreehouse.com. In the game, the user is prompted to guess a random number from 1 to 10. The user is given ten opportunities to guess the number. If the user guesses the number before the ten times are up, the loop ends and a message using innerHTML is printed to the screen. The user is told how many attempts it took them to guess the number. If the user never guesses the correct number, a message is printed to the screen, letting the user know they did not guess the number and what the number was._
